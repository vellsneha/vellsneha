# Sneha Vellelath

shipping thoughtful ML experiments.  
currently tinkering with agents, news intelligence, and co-creating a **DSA book**.

---

### 🌱 now
- building with **cloud + multi-agent systems**  
- exploring **news intelligence workflows**  
- contributed to a beginner-friendly **DSA mini-book** (brought structure & imagination to someone else’s expertise)
